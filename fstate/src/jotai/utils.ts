	 * Creates a Jotai atom from a sticky subscribable event bus.

	 * - Has its initial value set to the last event from the sticky subscribable.
	 * - Updates its state automatically when new events are emitted by the bus.
	 * - When mounted, subscribes to the bus and updates on new events.
	 *
	 * ### Important Usage Notices:
	 * - The atom needs to be mounted (used in a React component or subscribed in a store) before reading its value,
	 *   to ensure it reflects the latest event. Otherwise, the value may be stale if the bus emits events before mounting.
	 *
	 * It's safe to use with react and all subscribing listeners, however it's not safe to use with `JotaiStore.get` method, unless
	 * at least one subscription is online.
	 *
	 * @param bus StickySubscribable<T> - The sticky event bus to wrap into a Jotai atom.
	 * @returns Atom<T> A Jotai atom reflecting the current event value from the bus.
