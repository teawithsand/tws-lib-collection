# Sandbox Test Suite Summary

## Overview
I have added comprehensive tests for the Sandbox class, covering all major functionality including state management, event handling, PyScript support, and TypeScript compilation.

## Test Coverage

### Core Functionality Tests
1. **Basic sandbox execution and event emission** - Tests that code executes in the sandbox and events are properly emitted
2. **State management during loading** - Verifies that sandbox state is properly tracked through the loading lifecycle
3. **State reset on new HTML loading** - Ensures state is properly reset when loading new content

### Console and Error Handling Tests
4. **Console message types and levels** - Tests all console log levels (log, warn, error) with proper serialization
5. **Unhandled error handling** - Verifies that unhandled JavaScript errors are caught and reported
6. **Unhandled promise rejection handling** - Tests that rejected promises are properly captured
7. **Complex object serialization** - Tests serialization of various data types in console messages
8. **Malformed JavaScript handling** - Ensures the sandbox doesn't crash on syntax errors

### Event Bus Tests
9. **Event bus subscription and unsubscription** - Tests proper subscriber management
10. **Multiple subscribers** - Verifies that multiple subscribers can receive the same events

### Advanced Features Tests
11. **PyScript support** - Tests that PyScript can be loaded and executed with proper event emission
12. **TypeScript compilation and execution** - Tests the TypeScript compiler integration and code execution
13. **Empty HTML content handling** - Ensures the sandbox works with minimal content
14. **CSS and custom header entries** - Tests HTML builder's ability to add stylesheets and custom headers
15. **Script attributes handling** - Verifies proper script tag generation with various attributes

## Key Features Tested

### State Management
- ✅ `loaded` state tracking
- ✅ `domContentLoaded` state tracking  
- ✅ `hasErrored` state tracking
- ✅ `html` content tracking
- ✅ State reset on new content

### Event System
- ✅ Console messages (log, warn, error levels)
- ✅ Unhandled errors
- ✅ Unhandled promise rejections
- ✅ Event bus subscription/unsubscription
- ✅ Multiple subscribers support

### Content Execution
- ✅ JavaScript execution
- ✅ PyScript execution (Python in browser)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation and execution
- ✅ Error handling for malformed code

### HTML Builder Integration
- ✅ Custom header entries
- ✅ CSS stylesheet links
- ✅ Script tags with various attributes
- ✅ Inline styles
- ✅ Body content setting

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
All tests are run on both Chromium and Firefox to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 15 per browser (30 total)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Browsers**: Chromium and Firefox
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all major sandbox functionality

## Notable Test Patterns

### Async Event Waiting
Tests use proper async patterns to wait for events and state changes:
```typescript
await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    const checkEvents = () => {
        if (condition) {
            resolve()
        } else {
            setTimeout(checkEvents, 10)
        }
    }
    checkEvents()
})
```

### State Verification
Tests verify both immediate state changes and eventual consistency:
```typescript
const state = store.get(sandbox.state)
expect(state.loaded).toBe(true)
expect(state.hasErrored).toBe(false)
```

### Event Filtering and Verification
Tests properly filter and verify specific event types:
```typescript
const consoleEvents = events.filter(e => e.type === SandboxMessageType.CONSOLE)
const errorEvents = events.filter(e => e.type === SandboxMessageType.ERROR)
```

## Conclusion
The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the Sandbox functionality, ensuring reliable operation across different browsers and use cases. The tests verify both the core sandbox functionality and advanced features like PyScript and TypeScript support.
